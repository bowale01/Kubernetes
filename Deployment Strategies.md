In Kubernetes, there are several deployment strategies that you can implement to manage how new versions of applications are rolled out. Here are some of the most common deployment strategies along with methods and tools to implement them:

1. Rolling Updates
Description: Gradually replaces the old version of the application with the new version.

Implementation:

Use the default Deployment resource in Kubernetes.
Specify the strategy type as RollingUpdate.

2. Blue/Green Deployment
Description: Runs two environments (blue and green) where one (blue) is the live environment and the other (green) is the new version. After testing, traffic is switched to the green environment.

Implementation:

Use separate Deployment or ReplicaSet resources for blue and green.
Use a Service resource to switch traffic between blue and green.
Example:

Create two Deployments:
